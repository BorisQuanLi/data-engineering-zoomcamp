# Data Ingestion Approaches

## Approach 1: Using `pyarrow` to read Parquet and `pandas` to write to SQL in chunks

**Advantages:**
- Directly reads Parquet files, which is efficient for handling large datasets.
- Allows for chunked processing, which can help manage memory usage and improve performance.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires converting the Parquet data to a Pandas DataFrame before writing to SQL, which can be memory-intensive for very large datasets.

## Approach 2: Using `pandas.read_csv` with `iterator=True` and `chunksize`

**Advantages:**
- Efficient for reading large CSV files in chunks, which helps manage memory usage.
- Allows for chunked processing, which can improve performance and avoid memory issues.

**Disadvantages:**
- Only applicable to CSV files, not Parquet files. If your data is in Parquet format, you would need to convert it to CSV first.

## Example of Approach 2

Here is an example of how to use `pandas.read_csv` with `iterator=True` and `chunksize` to read a CSV file and write it to SQL in chunks:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create a SQLAlchemy engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:root@localhost:5433/ny_taxi")

# Read the CSV file in chunks
csv_file = "yellow_tripdata_2024-10.csv"
chunksize = 100000
csv_iterator = pd.read_csv(csv_file, iterator=True, chunksize=chunksize)

# Iterate over the chunks and write to SQL
for chunk in csv_iterator:
    chunk.to_sql("yellow_taxi_data", con=engine, if_exists="append")
    print(f"Written chunk with {len(chunk)} rows")
```

## Approach 3: Using Dask to read Parquet and write to SQL in chunks

**Advantages:**
- Scales to larger-than-memory datasets by breaking them into smaller partitions and processing them in parallel.
- Integrates well with the existing Python ecosystem, including Pandas and SQLAlchemy.
- Can improve performance by parallelizing operations and distributing the workload across multiple cores or machines.
- Can distribute the workload across different nodes in the cloud, enabling efficient processing of large datasets in a distributed computing environment.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires additional dependencies and setup.

## Example of Approach 3

Here is an example of how to use Dask to read a Parquet file and write it to SQL in chunks:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create a SQLAlchemy engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:root@localhost:5433/ny_taxi")

# Read the Parquet file using Dask
dask_df = dd.read_parquet("yellow_tripdata_2024-10.parquet")

# Convert Dask DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame in chunks and write to SQL
for chunk in dask_df.to_delayed():
    chunk_df = chunk.compute()
    chunk_df.to_sql("yellow_taxi_data", con=engine, if_exists="append")
    print(f"Written chunk with {len(chunk_df)} rows")
```

## Conclusion

- If your data is in Parquet format, the first approach using `pyarrow` and `pandas` is more suitable.
- If your data is in CSV format, the second approach using `pandas.read_csv` with `iterator=True` and `chunksize` is more efficient.
- If you need to handle larger-than-memory datasets or require parallel processing, the third approach using Dask is recommended.

Choose the approach that best fits your data format and processing requirements. If you need to handle both CSV and Parquet formats, you can implement multiple approaches and use the appropriate one based on the data format.
